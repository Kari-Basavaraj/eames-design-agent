# Research on A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface)

## Overview
This document captures research on Agentic UI patterns, AG-UI protocols, and GenUI implementations.

## Key Concepts
* **A2UI:** Agent-to-User Interface - protocols for agents to render UI dynamically
* **AG-UI:** Agentic UI - interfaces that adapt based on agent context
* **GenUI:** Generative UI - UI components generated on-the-fly by AI

## Research Notes
(Paste research findings and analysis here)

## Implementation Considerations
* How to stream UI components from agent responses
* Real-time rendering with CopilotKit or similar frameworks
* Component library integration with shadcn/ui
