# IDEA PATTERNS

> **Purpose:** Track cross-cutting themes that appear across multiple ideas/sources. When the same concept appears in 2+ places, it's a PATTERN worth prioritizing.

---

## 🎯 Why Patterns Matter

**Single idea** = Interesting, might be niche
**Pattern (2+ sources)** = Industry trend, proven valuable
**Strong pattern (3+ sources)** = Must-have, validated by market

Patterns get **higher priority** than isolated ideas because they're independently validated.

## 🔴 Critical Patterns

### PAT-001: User Interviewing Before Execution

**Occurrences:** 2 (Strong pattern)

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-001 (GSD) | "Questions" phase - asks until fully understood |
| FI-002 (claude-build-workflow) | BMAD Interview - interview before any autonomous execution |

**Core Insight:**
> Autonomous execution without understanding = expensive garbage.
> Upfront interviewing makes autonomy actually useful.

**Maps to Eames:**
- **Phase:** Discovery (new INTAKE substep)
- **Why Critical:** This is THE MOAT - what separates Eames from "code generator"

**Real Design Practice Equivalent:**
- User Research
- Stakeholder Interviews
- Requirements Gathering
- Scope Definition

**Implementation:**
- Add INTAKE step at start of Discovery
- Interview until: goals, constraints, preferences, edge cases captured
- User approves understanding before research begins

**Status:** 🔴 Critical - Must implement in V1.1.0 Phase 0

---

### PAT-002: Approval Gates

**Occurrences:** 1 (Emerging - watching for validation)

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-001 (GSD) | User approves roadmap BEFORE execution begins |

**Core Insight:**
> Autonomous ≠ Uncontrolled. Strategic checkpoints ensure alignment.

**Maps to Eames:**
- **Phases:** Discovery→Define, Define→Design, Develop→Deliver
- **Why Critical:** Prevents runaway autonomous execution

**Gates Needed:**
1. Post-Intake: "Do I understand correctly?"
2. Post-Define: "Does this roadmap match your vision?"
3. Pre-Deploy: "Ready to go live?"

**Status:** 🔴 Critical - Implement with PAT-001

---

## 🟡 High Priority Patterns

### PAT-003: Parallel Research Agents

**Occurrences:** 1 (Emerging)

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-001 (GSD) | 4 parallel researchers: competitor, technology, architecture, pitfalls |

**Core Insight:**
> Orchestrator coordinates, never does heavy lifting. Specialized agents work in parallel.

**Status:** 🟡 High - Implement in V1.1.0 Phase 2+

---

### PAT-004: Fresh Context Per Task

**Occurrences:** 1 (Emerging)

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-001 (GSD) | Each task executes with fresh 200k token context |

**Core Insight:**
> Main context stays clean while heavy work happens in subagent contexts.

**Status:** 🟡 High - Implement in V1.1.0 Phase 3+

---

## 🟢 Medium Priority Patterns

### PAT-005: Document-Based Context Management

**Occurrences:** 1 (Emerging)

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-001 (GSD) | PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, PLAN.md |

**Status:** 🟢 Medium - Consider for V1.1.0

```markdown
### PAT-XXX: [Pattern Name]

**Occurrences:** X

| Source | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| FI-XXX | [description] |
| FI-XXX | [description] |

**Core Insight:**
> [One sentence capturing the pattern's value]

**Maps to Eames:**
- **Phase:** [which phase(s)]
- **Why Important:** [Eames-specific reasoning]

**Real Design Practice Equivalent:**
- [List professional practices this mirrors]

**Implementation:**
- [Concrete steps to implement]

**Status:** [🔴 Critical / 🟡 High / 🟢 Medium / Adopted / Rejected]

## 🔍 How Pattern Detection Works

### Detection Mechanism (Semi-Automated)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Extract Concepts                                    │
│ Command extracts core concepts from source                  │
│ e.g., "user interviewing", "approval gates", "parallel"     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Keyword Search                                      │
│ Grep IDEA_PATTERNS.md for concept keywords                  │
│ e.g., grep "interview" → finds PAT-001                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 3: Match or Flag                                       │
│ IF match found:                                             │
│   → Link to existing PAT-XXX                                │
│   → Increment occurrence count                              │
│   → Add source to pattern's table                           │
│ IF no match but concept seems recurring:                    │
│   → Flag as "emerging pattern candidate"                    │
│   → User decides whether to create new PAT-XXX              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 4: Promotion (2+ sources)                              │
│ Pattern promoted from "Emerging" to "Validated" when:       │
│   → 2+ independent sources reference same concept           │
│   → User confirms it's the same underlying pattern          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Detection Is NOT
- ❌ **Not semantic similarity** (no embeddings/vectors)
- ❌ **Not fully automated** (user confirms matches)
- ❌ **Not fuzzy matching** (keyword-based)

### How Patterns Get Created

1. **Via /eames-analyze-reference:** Command finds concept matching existing pattern
2. **Manual:** When reviewing backlog and noticing theme
3. **Merge:** When two ideas realize they're the same underlying pattern
